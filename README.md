# X-49m
X-49m Custom HUD and flight controls 

This site is for the distribution of the LUA code for the X-49m. The X-49m is a compactable pocket rocket for Dual Universe. The cockpit and programming board are provided DRM free for easy upgrade or changing out the flight control systems. The code on this page will be the latest version and can be used to updgrade the ship code or replace it if you changed out the original HUD.  You can contact me on Discord at: KVeen#3678 if you have any questions

Installation Instructions:
1) The X-49m has a programming board installed direclty behind the cockpit. Install the programming board code by viewing the 'programming board' file in 'raw' selecting all code and pasting into the programming board in game.
2) Do the same with the cockpit unit.

**Ship Instructions**

A current limitation with DU is that custom HUD's cannot be direclty used with cockpit controllers. However, by using an external programming board, normal flight HUDs designed for cockpit ships can be utilized.

  1) The X-49m has a programming board installed directly behind the upper portion of the cockpit partially obscured in voxel. 
  2) Prior to entering the cockpit, manually activate the programming board to start the HUD
  3) Enter the cockpit
  4) Enjoy your flight!
  5) The programming board will automatically exit once you leave the cockpit so you will have to re-activate it manually before re-entering the cockpit.
